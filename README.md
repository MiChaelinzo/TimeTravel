# TimeTravel
An innovative snap lens: a "time travel" lens that allows you to take a picture or video of yourself and transport yourself to a different time period or location. For example, you could use the lens to take a picture of yourself as if you were standing in ancient Rome, or in the middle of a futuristic city. The lens could use augmented reality technology to add appropriate background elements to your camera view, such as historical landmarks or futuristic buildings. This could be a fun and creative way to "visit" different time periods and locations without actually having to travel.
