# TimeTravel
An innovative snap lens: a "time travel" lens that allows you to take a picture or video of yourself and transport yourself to a different time period or location. For example, you could use the lens to take a picture of yourself as if you were standing in ancient Rome, or in the middle of a futuristic city.
